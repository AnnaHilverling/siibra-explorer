# Fetching datasets from Knowledge Graph

Human Brain Project Knowledge Graph is a metadata database consisting of datasets contributed by collaborators of the Human Brain Project and curated by human curoators in order to ensure the highest standards. 

!!! note
    v2.3.0 changed the way datasets are fetched from the knowledge graph.

Datasets are now fetched from the knowledge graph on a region of interest basis.

Currently, only parcellation regions are supported.
