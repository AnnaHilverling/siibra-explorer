!!! warning
    Selecting no filter option is not the same as selecting all options. 
    
    There may be datasets without any _methods_ defined. These datasets will be shown if no filter is applied (deselecting all options), but will not show up if all options are selected

To reset all filters, `click` the `filter icon`
