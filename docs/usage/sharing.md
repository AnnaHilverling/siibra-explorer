# Sharing

Most of the viewer state are [saved in the URL](../advanced/url.md). Therefore, bookmarking / sending URL is a good way of saving / sharing a view of interest. Users may also generate a more human readable URL.

A share button has been added in [v2.2.0](../releases/v2.2.0.md) to simplify this process.

## Share URL

`Share link to this view` will attempt to copy the current URL to the clipboard. It can then be sent or saved to restore the current view.
